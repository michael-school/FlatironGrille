# Flatiron Grille
<p>Flatiron Grille is a fine-dining restaurant located in Jackson, TN. We created this website to provide an online menu, ordering system, and general information about the restaurant. We used a relatively simple and modern style that fits with Flatiron's theme and created a clear and concise user interface.</p>
<p>The authors are Shrey Patel, Michael Crockett, and Christian Wilcox from Madison Academic Magnet Highschool. We are <em>Big Men Doing Big Things, Making Big Money Moves</em> <strong>(BMDBTMBMM)</strong>.</p>

### Mobile First
<p>I periodically checked our site's responsiveness and made the necessary changes to ensure a "mobile first" approach.</p>

### Troubleshooting
### Cart
### Menu Structure
## Christian
<ul>
    <li>Made both of the 2 column sections and the fixed background in the home page.</li>
    <li>Added the toast that makes the "Thank you for the message!" notification appear in the contact page, and also made it to where the input boxes reset after clicking the "Send Message" button.</li>
    <li>Changed the color of the logo a little bit to make it look better, since the logo originally didn't blend in well to the navbar, and the red looked a bit faded, and also made the logo our favicon</li>
    <li>Added active classes to the navbar so it appears brighter depending on what page you are on.</li>
    <li>Added some of the pictures and captions that are featured in the gallery page.</li>
</ul>
