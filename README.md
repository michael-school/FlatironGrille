# Flatiron Grille
<p>Flatiron Grille is a fine-dining restaurant located in Jackson, TN. We created this website to provide an online menu, ordering system, and general information about the restaurant. We used a relatively simple and modern style that fits with Flatiron's theme and created a clear and concise user interface.</p>

<ul>
    <li>I made both of the 2 column sections and the fixed background in the home page.</li>
    <li>I added the toast that makes the "Thank you for the message!" notification appear in the contact page. I also made it to where the input boxes reset after clicking the "Send Message" button.</li>
    <li>Our logo originally didn't blend in well to the navbar, and the red looked a bit faded so I changed the color of the logo a little bit to make it look better. I also made the logo our favicon.</li>
    <li>I added active classes to the navbar so it appears brighter depending on what page you are on.</li>
    <li>I added some of the pictures and captions that are featured in the gallery page.</li>
