# Flatiron Grille
<p>Flatiron Grille is a fine-dining restaurant located in Jackson, TN. We created this website to provide an online menu, ordering system, and general information about the restaurant. We used a relatively simple and modern style that fits with Flatiron's theme and created a clear and concise user interface.</p>

## Christian
<ul>
    <li>Made both of the 2 column sections and the fixed background in the home page.</li>
    <li>Added the toast that makes the "Thank you for the message!" notification appear in the contact page, and also made it to where the input boxes reset after clicking the "Send Message" button.</li>
    <li>Changed the color of the logo a little bit to make it look better, since the logo originally didn't blend in well to the navbar, and the red looked a bit faded, and also made the logo our favicon</li>
    <li>Added active classes to the navbar so it appears brighter depending on what page you are on.</li>
    <li>Added some of the pictures and captions that are featured in the gallery page.</li>
    <li>I would fix small things around the website that made it just a tad bit better.</li>
